<pre> Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
 Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,
 such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that
 abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.

 Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with
 various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not
 assume they are safe for parallel execution.</pre>
